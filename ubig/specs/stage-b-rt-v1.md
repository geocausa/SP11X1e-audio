# UbiG Stage-B RT analysis contract v1

The deployed SP11 VR inner loop contains a universal band-analysis row builder used by every public profile. UbiG owns this arithmetic natively; no proprietary coefficient tables are required by this block.

## Complex energy reducer

`ubig_stage_b_rt_complex_energy()` accepts pointers to interleaved complex rows and a half-open complex-bin range. It accumulates real and imaginary squares in separate binary64 accumulators with fused multiply-adds, combines them in binary64, then converts once to binary32.

Promoted-source private differential: **1,000,000 randomized calls bit-exact**. Public synthetic regression hash: `1faa4ac9654c888c`.

## Band-energy/log row builder

`ubig_stage_b_rt_band_log_process()` groups caller-owned complex rows by output row, optionally appends auxiliary vectors for the first two groups, integrates successive caller-owned band boundaries, applies the already-proven native fast-log2 approximation scaled by exact binary32 `0x3cbdb1f9`, clamps its log floor, subtracts the two caller controls, clamps into the deployed Leveler row domain, clears telemetry, and fills inactive tail lanes with exact `-1.0f`.

The deployed contract permits at most 25 selected complex rows and 20 active bands. No SP11 lookup/tuning table is embedded by this module.

Promoted-source private differential: **200,000 complete randomized calls bit-exact**, covering grouping, optional auxiliary vectors, boundary geometry, row counts, widths, capacities, offsets, outputs, and telemetry. Public synthetic regression hash: `2a3371c6a974905c`.
